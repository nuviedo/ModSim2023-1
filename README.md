Final Project for the Modelling & Simulation 2023-1 class, taught by Dr. Victor de la Luz at the _Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México_ (National Autonomous University of México | UNAM), in its _Escuela Nacional de Estudios Superiores Unidad Morelia_ Campus (National School of Superior-Level Studies, _Morelia_ Campus | ENES Morelia), as part of its _Licenciatura en Tecnologías para la Información en Ciencias_ career plan (Bs. in Information Technologies applied to Science | L.T.I.C.).

### Introduction
The following project details the design & implementation of an N-Body Simulation that describes the movement of the Solar System using initial conditions derived from the current day.
This came to our attention given the desire to experiment with the boundaries of N-Body Simulation for large scale bodies in class.

An N-Body simulation is a numerical approximation to solving the problem that arises when attempting to simulate interconnected motion between more than two physical bodies, given that their interactions do not occur in any specific order.

### Objective
The aim of this project is to produce several graphs which model the 3D positions in space of the Sun and the 8 planets of the Solar System over a specified period of time.

### Libraries
The project is expected to be developed making use of several python 3.10+ libraries, such as the following:

* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [seaborn](http://seaborn.pydata.org/)
* [scipy](https://scipy.org/)
